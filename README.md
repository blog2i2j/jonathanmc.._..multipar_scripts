# multipar_scripts

## How to use

Use this script with MULTIPAR to generate checksums for files, or for directories, automatically.
1. Needs par2j64.exe in path or current dir
2. Leave only one of method 1 or 2 or 3 uncommented
3. You can put this batch file in your SENDTO directory, and invoke it with mouse right-click
4. Rename this file .bat before you do

You can make more than one .BAT file, and put them in your SENDTO directory, so you can select which options you want to use. Personally, I have two that PAR directories at different redundancy levels and two that PAR individual files at different redundancy levels.

Note if you select too many files when PAR'g individual files, the script will just crash. Select fewer and try again.

If you make this better, please fork and I'll re-integrate. GPL v3 so you must propagate source and if you modify or make anything using this, it has to be GPL v3 as well.
